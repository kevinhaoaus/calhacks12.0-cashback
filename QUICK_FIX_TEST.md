## 🔧 Fix the Tracked Price Data (Optional)

If you want to test the price tracking integration, you need to fix the tracked price in the database.

**Manual fix via Supabase:**

1. Go to https://hirzlkuklsoewbyiibsx.supabase.co
2. Navigate to Table Editor → `price_tracking`
3. Find the row for your Amazon purchase
4. Update `current_price` to something **lower** than 10.99, like `7.99`
5. Set `price_drop_detected` = `true`
6. Set `price_drop_amount` = `3.00` (10.99 - 7.99)
7. Save
8. Refresh your app
9. Now the "Use tracked price" button will show $7.99

## 🎬 Recommended Testing Order

1. **Test Full Return** (easiest, no issues)
   - Select "Full Return"
   - Click "Generate Email"
   - Should generate professional return email
   - Refund amount: $10.99

2. **Test Price Drop with Manual Entry**
   - Select "Price Drop Adjustment"
   - Enter: `7.99`
   - Should show: "Potential refund: $3.00"
   - Click "Generate Email"
   - Should generate price drop email mentioning the $3.00 difference

3. **Test Price Match** (if you have a purchase from Target/Walmart/Best Buy)
   - Only works for retailers with `has_price_match = true`
   - Amazon doesn't support price matching (correctly grayed out in your screenshot)

   Subject: Price Adjustment Request - Amazon Purchase

   Dear Amazon Customer Service,

   I recently purchased an item on August 29, 2025, for $10.99.
   I noticed the same product is now available for $7.99...

   [Professional, polite email with all details]
   ```

## 💡 Why This Validation Exists

The validation prevents impossible scenarios:
- You can't get a refund if the price **increased**
- You can only get a refund if the price **decreased**
- Original: $10.99 → Current: $15.99 = Price went UP (no refund possible)
- Original: $10.99 → Current: $7.99 = Price went DOWN (refund possible)

This is correct business logic!

## ✅ Try This Right Now

Close the dialog and:

1. Click **"Request Refund"** on the Amazon purchase
2. Click **"Full Return"** (top option)
3. Click **"Generate Email"**

This should work immediately with no errors!
