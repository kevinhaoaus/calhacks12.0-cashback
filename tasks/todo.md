## Current Task: Auto-Suggest Product URLs for Price Tracking ✅

### Problem
Users have no way to add products for price tracking. The price tracking infrastructure exists but there's no UI to start tracking products from purchases.

### Solution Implemented

Implemented an AI-powered auto-suggest feature that:
1. Adds "Track Price" button to each purchase in Recent Purchases (only shows if not already tracking)
2. When clicked, uses Claude with Web Search to find the product URL automatically
3. Shows up to 3 suggested URLs to user for confirmation
4. Allows manual URL input as fallback
5. Starts price tracking once confirmed
6. Shows success state and refreshes dashboard

### Files Created

- `src/app/api/suggest-product-url/route.ts` - API endpoint using Claude + Web Search to find product URLs
- `src/components/track-price-dialog.tsx` - Modal dialog for URL suggestions and confirmation
- `src/components/purchases-list.tsx` - Client component with Track Price buttons

### Files Modified

- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Uses new PurchasesList component

### Features

- **AI-Powered URL Discovery**: Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 with web_search tool to find product pages
- **Smart Filtering**: Only shows URLs from supported retailers (Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Home Depot, eBay)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each suggestion has a confidence level (high/medium/low)
- **Manual Override**: Users can enter custom URLs if suggestions aren't accurate
- **Auto-fetch**: Suggestions load automatically when dialog opens
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if AI search fails
- **Success Feedback**: Visual confirmation when tracking starts
- **Conditional Display**: Track Price button only shows on purchases not already being tracked
