# Current Task: Add 100+ More Retailers to Bright Data Support

## Goal
Expand Bright Data coverage from 6 retailers to 100+ retailers to maximize successful price scraping and minimize fallback to Claude AI.

## Plan

### Task 1: Research Bright Data supported retailers
- [x] Check Bright Data documentation for available datasets
- [x] Identify major e-commerce platforms

### Task 2: Update getDatasetForUrl() function
- [ ] Add 100+ retailer domain mappings
- [ ] Organize by category (electronics, fashion, home, etc.)
- [ ] Use appropriate Bright Data dataset IDs

### Task 3: Test and commit changes
- [ ] Verify the mapping logic works
- [ ] Commit changes to git
- [ ] Push to GitHub

## Implementation Notes

Bright Data has a "Web Scraper" dataset that works for any website, so we'll map popular retailers to it.
