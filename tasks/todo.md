## Review

### Phase 1 Completed ✅

**Changes Made:**

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialized Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and App Router
   - Installed dependencies: Supabase, Anthropic SDK, React Query, Zod, React Hook Form
   - Configured shadcn/ui with Button, Card, Input, Form, Label components

2. **Supabase Integration**
   - Created client utilities for browser (`client.ts`) and server (`server.ts`)
   - Set up auth middleware for protected routes
   - Prepared complete database schema in `supabase/schema.sql`
   - Schema includes: retailers, user_settings, purchases, price_tracking, refund_requests, notifications, api_logs

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Built login page (`/login`)
   - Built signup page (`/signup`)
   - Built dashboard page (`/dashboard`)
   - Implemented signout API route
   - Added middleware for route protection

4. **Landing Page**
   - Created marketing page with feature highlights
   - Added "How It Works" section
   - Designed with gradient background and cards

5. **Configuration**
   - Created `.env.local.example` with all required env vars
   - Set up `.env.local` for development
   - Created `SETUP.md` with deployment instructions

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`
- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`
- `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts`
- `src/lib/anthropic/index.ts`
- `src/middleware.ts`
- `src/app/page.tsx` (updated)
- `src/app/login/page.tsx`
- `src/app/signup/page.tsx`
- `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `src/app/api/auth/signout/route.ts`
- `supabase/schema.sql`
- `.env.local.example`
- `.env.local`
- `SETUP.md`

**Next Steps:**
- User needs to create Supabase project and add credentials to `.env.local`
- User needs to run the database schema in Supabase SQL Editor
- User needs to get Anthropic API key
- After setup, run `npm run dev` to test the application

**Impact:**
- Minimal, simple changes - only added necessary authentication foundation
- No complex changes - straightforward setup following Next.js and Supabase best practices
- Everything follows the principle of simplicity as requested
