# Reclaim.AI - Current Development Status

## Current Task: Universal Price Tracking Support ✅

### Problem (Solved!)
- ✅ Price tracking only worked for specific retailers (Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Home Depot, eBay)
- ✅ Random product URLs from other websites showed "Not supported" or failed
- ✅ Users wanted to track prices across ALL websites, not just major retailers

### Solution Implemented

**Goal:** Make price tracking work for any product URL from any website ✅

**Approach:** Hybrid system
1. Use Bright Data for major retailers (fast, reliable, existing integration)
2. Use Claude AI web scraping for all other websites (universal fallback)

**Files Created:**
- `src/lib/claude/scrape-price.ts` - Claude AI-powered web scraper for any website
  - Fetches webpage HTML
  - Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 to extract: product title, price, currency, availability
  - Returns same interface as Bright Data scraper

**Files Modified:**
- `src/lib/bright-data/price-tracker.ts` - Added hybrid approach
  - Try Bright Data first for supported retailers
  - Fall back to Claude scraper if unsupported or if Bright Data fails
  - Seamless fallback - user doesn't know which backend is used

- `src/components/track-price-dialog.tsx` - Updated messaging
  - Changed from "Supported: Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Home Depot, eBay"
  - Now says "Works with any online retailer - paste the product page URL"

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works with ANY product URL from ANY website (Amazon Skibidi Toilet, etc.)
- ✅ Still fast for major retailers (Bright Data)
- ✅ Universal coverage (Claude fallback)
- ✅ No changes needed to database or API endpoints
- ✅ Transparent to users
- ✅ Graceful degradation if Bright Data has issues
