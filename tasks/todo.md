## Current Task: Add Price Tracking Visibility to Dashboard ✅

### Problem
Price tracking is happening in the background, but users can't see:
- What products are being tracked
- Current prices vs original prices
- Price history
- Ability to remove items from tracking

### Solution Implemented

- [x] Created a new "Price Tracking" card section on the dashboard below the forwarding email card
- [x] Created a client component for the price tracking list (`src/components/price-tracking-list.tsx`)
- [x] Fetch all active price tracking records and display:
  - Product name
  - Product URL (truncated, with link)
  - Original price
  - Current price
  - Lowest price seen
  - Price change indicator (% change, colored with icons)
  - Last checked timestamp
  - "Remove" button for each item
- [x] Implemented remove tracking functionality with optimistic UI updates
- [x] Added empty state when no items are being tracked

### Changes Made

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/price-tracking-list.tsx` - Client component for displaying and managing price tracking
