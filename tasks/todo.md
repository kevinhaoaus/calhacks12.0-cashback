# Current Task: Fix Price Tracking Failures & Add Detailed Error Logging

## Goal
Debug why price tracking is failing for Dick's Sporting Goods and add comprehensive error logging to identify the root cause.

## Plan

### Task 1: Add detailed error logging
- [ ] Add console.log statements throughout the price tracking flow
- [ ] Log Bright Data API responses and errors
- [ ] Log Claude fallback attempts
- [ ] Return detailed error messages to the frontend

### Task 2: Test Bright Data credentials
- [ ] Create a test script to validate Bright Data API credentials
- [ ] Test the API endpoint with a simple request
- [ ] Verify customer ID and API key are correct

### Task 3: Improve error handling
- [ ] Better error messages for different failure scenarios
- [ ] Show user-friendly errors instead of generic "Failed to start price tracking"
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures

## Implementation Notes

The issue is likely one of:
1. Bright Data API credentials are invalid/expired
2. Bright Data is timing out on Dick's Sporting Goods
3. Claude fallback is also failing
4. Network/CORS issues

## Review
(To be filled after completion)
