# Fix Landing Page URL Links ✅

## Review - Fixed Login and Signup Button Links

### What Was Fixed
Fixed all broken navigation links on the landing page that were redirecting to a non-existent `/auth` page.

### Files Modified
1. **`src/components/header.tsx`** (line 36):
   - Changed "Log in" button link from `/auth` to `/login`

2. **`src/components/cta-section.tsx`** (line 39):
   - Changed "Start reclaiming money" button link from `/auth` to `/signup`

### Changes Summary
- Header "Log in" button: `/auth` → `/login`
- CTA "Start reclaiming money" button: `/auth` → `/signup`
- Hero "Start reclaiming money" button was already correct at `/signup`

### Impact
**Before:**
- Clicking "Log in" or "Start reclaiming money" buttons redirected to `/auth` (404 page)
- Users couldn't access the login or signup pages from the landing page

**After:**
- "Log in" button correctly redirects to `/login`
- "Start reclaiming money" buttons correctly redirect to `/signup`
- All navigation works as expected

### Simple, Minimal Changes
- Modified 2 files
- Changed 2 URLs total
- No functional changes, just URL corrections
- Zero impact on other parts of the codebase

# Universal Return Policy Scraper

## Review - Universal Return Policy Scraper ✅

### What Was Built

Created a **universal return policy scraper** that automatically fetches return/exchange policies for ANY merchant, not just the 20 hardcoded retailers.

### Files Created
1. **`src/lib/claude/scrape-return-policy.ts`** - Main scraper library with 3 key functions:
   - `findReturnPolicyUrl()` - Uses Claude AI + web search to discover the return policy page URL for any merchant
   - `extractReturnPolicyFromUrl()` - Scrapes and extracts structured policy data (text, return days, price match info) using Claude AI
   - `scrapeReturnPolicy()` - Complete workflow combining both steps

### Files Modified
1. **`src/app/api/purchases/route.ts`** - Integrated policy scraping into manual purchase creation:
   - When a purchase is added, checks if retailer has a policy
   - If retailer exists but has no policy → scrapes and updates
   - If retailer doesn't exist → creates new retailer with scraped policy
   - Return analysis now runs for ALL merchants (was never running before!)

2. **`src/app/api/webhooks/email/route.ts`** - Same integration for email-forwarded receipts:
   - Email receipts now trigger automatic policy scraping
   - Ensures both upload methods benefit from universal policy support

### How It Works

**Similar to the universal price scraper:**
1. **Find the policy URL**: Claude AI uses web search to locate "{merchant} return policy" page
2. **Fetch the HTML**: Standard HTTP request with proper user agent
3. **Extract content**: Smart HTML parsing to find main policy content (removes headers/footers/nav)
4. **Structure the data**: Claude AI extracts:
   - Clean policy summary text (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Return window in days (30, 60, 90, etc.)
   - Price match availability and time window
   - Confidence score
5. **Cache in database**: Store policy with timestamp for reuse

### Key Features
- ✅ **Universal Support**: Works for ANY merchant website, not just major retailers
- ✅ **Automatic**: Scrapes policies on-demand when first encountered
- ✅ **Smart Fallback**: If web search fails, tries common URL patterns (/returns, /return-policy, etc.)
- ✅ **Cached**: Policies stored in database with timestamps (can refresh if stale)
- ✅ **Non-Blocking**: If scraping fails, purchase still completes (degrades gracefully)
- ✅ **Return Analysis Now Works**: The existing `analyze-return.ts` code can finally run!

### Impact

**Before:**
- Only 20 retailers with hardcoded return days (30, 90, etc.)
- NO actual policy text in database
- Return eligibility analysis NEVER ran (always null)
- System couldn't work with unknown merchants

**After:**
- Works with ANY merchant
- Policies are automatically scraped and cached
- Return eligibility analysis runs for all merchants
- Accurate return days from actual policies, not defaults
- Price match information extracted automatically

### Example Flow

1. User uploads a receipt from "Patagonia" (not in the 20 hardcoded retailers)
2. System finds no retailer → triggers `scrapeReturnPolicy("Patagonia")`
3. Claude finds policy URL: `https://www.patagonia.com/returns-warranty.html`
4. Scrapes and extracts:
   - Return days: 60
   - Price match: No
   - Policy text: "Patagonia offers a 60-day return window..."
5. Creates retailer record with policy
6. Runs return eligibility analysis with actual policy text
7. Purchase is saved with accurate return deadline and analysis

This was previously impossible - it would just use 30-day default and skip analysis.

### Simple, Minimal Changes
- Created 1 new library file (similar pattern to price scraping)
- Modified 2 existing API routes (added policy scraping before analysis)
- No database schema changes needed (tables already supported policies)
- No UI changes needed (automatic behind the scenes)

The system now has **universal merchant support** for return policies, just like it has for price tracking!
