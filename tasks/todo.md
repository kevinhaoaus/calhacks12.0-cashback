# Fix: Refund Request "Mark as Sent" Error

## Problem 🐛

When generating a refund email and clicking "Mark as Sent", users get this error:
```
Refund request not found or update failed
```

The refund request is created but cannot be updated to mark it as sent.

## Root Cause 🔍

**Missing RLS (Row Level Security) policy in Supabase**

The database has:
- ✅ SELECT policy for `refund_requests` (users can view their own)
- ✅ INSERT policy for `refund_requests` (users can create their own)
- ❌ **Missing UPDATE policy** (users cannot update their own)

When "Mark as Sent" is clicked, the PATCH endpoint tries to update the refund_request but fails because there's no RLS policy allowing it.

**Files involved:**
- `supabase/fix-rls-policies.sql` - Has INSERT policy but missing UPDATE policy
- `src/app/api/refund/generate/route.ts:239-250` - PATCH endpoint that fails
- `src/components/refund-dialog.tsx:125-156` - Frontend that calls the PATCH

## Plan 📋

### Todo Items

- [x] Add UPDATE policy for refund_requests table in fix-rls-policies.sql
- [x] Create standalone migration script for easy deployment
- [ ] Test the fix by running the SQL in Supabase
- [ ] Verify "Mark as Sent" button works end-to-end

## Implementation ✅

### Changes Made

1. **Updated `supabase/fix-rls-policies.sql`**
   - Added UPDATE policy for refund_requests (line 18-20)
   - Allows users to update their own refund requests securely

2. **Created `supabase/migrations/fix-refund-update-policy.sql`**
   - Standalone migration script for this specific fix
   - Easier to apply just this one change

### The Fix

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own refund requests" ON refund_requests
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

This allows users to update only their own refund requests, maintaining security while fixing the functionality.

## How to Apply the Fix 🚀

**Option 1: Run the migration script (Recommended)**
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/fix-refund-update-policy.sql`
4. Click "Run"

**Option 2: Run the entire fix-rls-policies.sql**
- If you haven't run `supabase/fix-rls-policies.sql` yet, run the whole file
- It includes this fix plus other important RLS policies

## Testing Instructions 🧪

After applying the SQL fix:

1. **Generate a refund email:**
   - Go to your app
   - Navigate to a purchase
   - Click "Request Refund"
   - Fill in the details and generate an email

2. **Mark as sent:**
   - Click the "Mark as Sent" button
   - Should show success message ✅
   - Dialog should close and page should reload
   - No error should appear ❌

3. **Verify in database:**
   - Check the refund_requests table
   - The record should have:
     - `email_sent = true`
     - `email_sent_at = [timestamp]`
     - `status = 'sent'`
