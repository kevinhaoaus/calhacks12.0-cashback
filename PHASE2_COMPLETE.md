# Phase 2 Complete - AI-Powered Receipt Processing âœ…

## Summary

Successfully implemented Phase 2 of Reclaim.AI - email processing and Claude AI integration for intelligent receipt parsing and purchase tracking!

## What Was Built

### 1. Claude AI Integration

**Receipt Extraction** (`src/lib/claude/extract-receipt.ts`)
- Extracts merchant, date, total, currency, items from receipt text
- Returns structured JSON with confidence scores
- Handles various receipt formats

**Return Policy Analysis** (`src/lib/claude/analyze-return.ts`)
- Analyzes if purchases are still returnable
- Calculates days remaining in return window
- Provides intelligent recommendations
- Uses Claude Sonnet 4.5 for complex reasoning

**Refund Email Generation** (`src/lib/claude/generate-refund-email.ts`)
- Creates professional refund request emails
- Customizes tone based on situation
- Includes all relevant purchase details

### 2. API Endpoints

**Email Webhook** (`/api/webhooks/email`)
- Receives forwarded emails from Cloudflare Worker
- Extracts receipt text automatically
- Uses Claude to parse purchase data
- Saves to database with AI analysis

**Purchases API** (`/api/purchases`)
- GET: List all user purchases with analytics
- POST: Manually add purchase for testing
- Returns full purchase data with return deadlines

### 3. Enhanced Dashboard

**Features Added:**
- User-specific forwarding email display
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Recent purchases list with return deadlines
- Color-coded urgency (green/orange/red)
- Real-time stats calculation
- Auto-create user settings on first login

**Stats Displayed:**
- Total potential savings
- Active purchases count
- Expiring soon (within 7 days)

### 4. Test Interface

**Test Page** (`/test`)
- 3 sample receipts (Target, Walmart, Amazon)
- Live receipt parsing with Claude
- Real-time extraction results
- Confidence score visualization
- Redirects to dashboard after success

### 5. Cloudflare Email Worker

**Complete Setup** (`cloudflare-worker/`)
- Email routing worker code
- Wrangler configuration
- Deployment instructions
- Forwards emails to API webhook

## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ claude/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ extract-receipt.ts      # AI receipt parsing
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ analyze-return.ts       # Return policy analysis
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ generate-refund-email.ts # Email generation

```

## How It Works

### Receipt Processing Flow

1. **Email Arrives** â†’ Cloudflare Email Routing receives it
2. **Worker Processes** â†’ Extracts content and forwards to API
3. **Claude Extracts** â†’ AI parses merchant, date, items, total
4. **Database Saves** â†’ Purchase stored with return deadline
5. **User Notified** â†’ Dashboard updates automatically

### Test Flow (Without Email)

1. **User visits `/test`**
2. **Pastes receipt text** or loads sample
3. **Clicks "Process Receipt"**
4. **Claude extracts data** in real-time
5. **Results displayed** with confidence score
6. **Redirects to dashboard** to view purchase

## Demo Instructions

### Quick Test (No Setup Required)

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Sign up for an account
3. Click "Test with Sample Receipt" on dashboard
4. Select Target, Walmart, or Amazon sample
5. Click "Process Receipt"
6. Watch Claude AI extract the data
7. View purchase on dashboard

### With Anthropic API Key

1. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to `.env.local`
2. Follow quick test steps above
3. Real Claude AI parsing will work!

### Full Email Setup (Optional)

1. Deploy Cloudflare Worker
2. Configure email routing
3. Forward receipts to your forwarding email
4. Watch automatic processing!
