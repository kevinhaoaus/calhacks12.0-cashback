SELECT
  rr.id,
  rr.refund_type,
  rr.refund_amount,
  rr.email_subject,
  rr.email_sent,
  rr.status,
  rr.created_at,
  p.merchant_name,
  p.total_amount
FROM refund_requests rr
JOIN purchases p ON rr.purchase_id = p.id
ORDER BY rr.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check notifications created
SELECT *
FROM notifications
WHERE type = 'refund_update'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected**:
