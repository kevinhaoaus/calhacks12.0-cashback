## 📊 Database Integration

### Refund Requests Table

All generated refunds are saved to `refund_requests` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE refund_requests (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  purchase_id UUID REFERENCES purchases(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),

  -- Request details
  refund_type VARCHAR(50), -- price_drop, return, price_match
  refund_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  reason TEXT,

  -- Generated email (by Claude)
  email_subject VARCHAR(500),
  email_body TEXT,
  email_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  email_sent_at TIMESTAMP,

  -- Status tracking
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'draft', -- draft, sent, approved, denied

  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**RLS Policies:**
- ✅ Users can only access their own refund requests
- ✅ Enforced at database level

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Visual Design

**Button Styling:**
```tsx
<Button className="border-[#16A34A] text-[#16A34A] hover:bg-[#16A34A] hover:text-white">
  <DollarSign className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />
  Request Refund
</Button>
```

- Green color scheme for refunds (money theme)
- Positioned prominently on each purchase card
- Shows for all purchases (not conditional)

**Dialog Features:**
- ✅ Purchase summary card
- ✅ Visual refund type cards with icons
- ✅ Real-time refund amount calculation
- ✅ Price tracking integration (auto-fill current price)
- ✅ Disabled state for unsupported features
- ✅ Copy to clipboard with visual feedback
- ✅ Success animations

---

## 💰 Smart Features

### Price Tracking Integration

If user has price tracking active:
- Shows current tracked price in Price Drop card
- "Use tracked price" button to auto-fill
- Highlights potential savings

Example:
```
Price Drop Adjustment
Request a refund for the difference due to a price decrease
💰 Current tracked price: $89.99
[Use tracked price ($89.99)]
```

### Retailer Policy Integration

For Price Match:
- Automatically checks if retailer supports price matching
- Disables option if not supported
- Shows helpful message: "This retailer doesn't offer price matching"

### Smart Validation

- Prevents generating email if current price >= original price
- Shows real-time refund calculation
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs

---

## 🔒 Security Features

### Validation (Phase 1 Integration)

```typescript
import { RefundTypeSchema, UuidSchema, formatValidationError } from '@/lib/validation/schemas';

// Validates:
- refund_type: Must be 'price_drop' | 'return' | 'price_match'
- purchase_id: Must be valid UUID
- current_price: Must be positive number (if provided)
- current_price < original_price (enforced)
```

### Authentication & Authorization

- ✅ User must be authenticated (JWT)
- ✅ Purchase must belong to user (RLS)
- ✅ Refund request tied to user_id
- ✅ No cross-user data leakage

### Error Handling (Phase 2 Integration)

```typescript
const generatedEmail = await retryWithTimeout(
  () => generateRefundEmail(refundType, purchaseData, userInfo),
  {
    maxRetries: 3,
    baseDelay: 1000,
    timeoutMs: 30000,
    onRetry: (attempt, error) => {
      console.log(`Retrying refund email generation (attempt ${attempt})`);
    }
  }
);
```

- ✅ 30-second timeout on AI generation
- ✅ Automatic retries (3 attempts)
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging

---

## 📈 Performance

### AI Generation Time

- **Average**: 3-8 seconds
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Retries**: Up to 3 attempts
- **Cache**: Email saved to database (no regeneration needed)

### Loading States

- Shows "Generating..." spinner during API call
- Disables buttons while processing
- Smooth transitions between states

---

## 🧪 Example Generated Email

### Input:
```json
{
  "refund_type": "price_drop",
  "merchant": "Best Buy",
  "original_price": 299.99,
  "current_price": 249.99,
  "purchase_date": "2025-10-15"
}
```

### Output (AI-Generated):
```

assistance in processing this adjustment.

Purchase Details:
- Purchase Date: October 15, 2025
